# Tournament Management System

This is a thesis project for PJATK.

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to create an `.env` file at the root of the project. Example of the `.env` file with all the necessary fields is included below.

```dotenv
# Environemntal variables used in Spring Boot configuration (application.yml)
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_NAME=tournaments
```

Alternatively, those variables can be passed as system environment variables or command-line arguments.
